This repository contains the implementation of a resource package for IBMÂ® Telco Network Cloud - Orchestration that creates and manages an Apache server on OpenStack.
The resource package uses the Openstack VIM Driver for the lifecycle transitions *Create*, *Adopt* and *Delete* and the Ansible Lifecycle Driver for the lifecycle transitions *Install*, *Configure*, *Start* and *Stop*.

In the *docs* folder you can find an [Adopt walkthrough example](./docs/adopt.md) that uses this resource package.
